  "page-home-shardeum-home-title": "Shardeum Features",
  "shm-feature-1-title": "EVM based layer 1 network",
  "shm-feature-1-desc": "Since you just need to deploy a smart contract written in developer-friendly languages like Solidity & Vyper on Shardeum, it is tailor-made for both new & existing developers to build dapps within minutes.",
  "shm-feature-2-title": "Dynamic state sharding",
  "shm-feature-2-desc": "Nodes on Shardeum are assigned dynamic address ranges across multiple shards. Since the consensus takes place at the transaction level, the network will retain parallel and atomic processing of transactions resulting in linear scalability.",
  "shm-feature-3-title": "Linear scalability & low gas forever",
  "shm-feature-3-desc": "Through <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/dynamic-state-sharding-shardeum/' target='_blank' >dynamic state sharding</a>, Shardeum will scale linearly. Every node that joins the Shardeum network immediately increases the transactions per second (TPS) capacity, thus ensuring low transaction fees even as the usage grows.",
  "shm-feature-4-title": "Anyone can operate a node",
  "shm-feature-4-desc": "Since historical data on Shardeum will be offloaded to archive nodes on top of its <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/shardeum-solves-blockchain-trilemma/' target='_blank' >linear scalability</a>, hardware requirements to run a node on the network will be low. With the help of GUI, even non-technical users can run a node easily.",
  "shm-feature-5-title": "Autoscaling & high fairness",
  "shm-feature-5-desc": "Shardeum will <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/worlds-first-auto-scaling-demo-by-blockchain-network/' target='_blank' >autoscale</a> dynamically based on demand in the network keeping its operational cost low to retain low gas fees. The network will further process transactions on FCFS basis to ensure high fairness eliminating MEV.",
  "shm-feature-6-title": "Solid security",
  "shm-feature-6-desc": "A leaderless <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/consensus-mechanism-used-in-shardeum/' target='_blank' >Proof-of-Quorum</a> (PoQ) consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with slashing, standby nodes, node rotation and permissionless participation - all contributes to boost the security of the network.",
  "shm-feature-7-title": "Setup Shardeum Testnet",
  "shm-feature-7-desc": "Add Shardeum testnet to your wallet, claim test SHM, deploy your contract and dapps seamlessly on the EVM network.",
  "shm-feature-8-title": "Deploy Your Dapp",
  "shm-feature-8-desc": "Deploy global-scale dapps effortlessly on Shardeum's linearly scalable network with comprehensive developer documentation, and never worry about rising gas fees again",
  "shm-feature-9-title": "Run a Validator",
  "shm-feature-9-desc": "Say goodbye to resource-intensive node running on blockchain networks. With Shardeum's user-friendly GUI and minimal hardware requirements, validator setup is a breeze",
  "shm-feature-10-title": "Shardeum Explorer",
  "shm-feature-10-desc": "Uncover the power of Shardeum with our intuitive explorer. Track transactions, monitor activity, and gain deep insights into the decentralized world",
  "shm-feature-11-title": "EVM compatible",
  "shm-feature-11-desc": "Since you just need to deploy a smart contract written in developer-friendly languages like Solidity & Vyper on Shardeum, it is tailor-made for both new & existing developers to build dapps within minutes.",
  "shm-feature-12-title": "Instant transaction finality",
  "shm-feature-12-desc": "Shardeum processes transactions individually with <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/shardeum-solves-blockchain-trilemma/' target='_blank' >cross shard composability</a> instead of processing them at the block level resulting in fully confirmed transaction time of just a few seconds.",
  "shm-feature-13-title": "Secure & trustless",
  "shm-feature-13-desc": "A leaderless <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/consensus-mechanism-used-in-shardeum/' target='_blank' >Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ)</a> consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with slashing, standby nodes, node rotation and permissionless participation - all contribute to boost the security of the network.",
